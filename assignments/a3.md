# Assignment 3


**Due: Monday Sep 30th at 11:59 pm ET**

This assignment is a follow up to Assignment 1, and the goal is to complete the NASA TOPS Open Science 101 online course by finishing modules 4, and 5. The modules are designed in a way that you have to complete them in sequence. Make sure to complete the **regular modules and NOT the fast track ones**. After finishing these 5 modules, you will receive an online certificate from NASA that you can reference in your resume or online profiles like LinkedIn. 

Steps to complete, and report back:
- Navigate to NASA TOPS Open Science 101 page [here](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/take-os101/). 
- Log in using your existing account from Assignment 1. 
- After completing modules 4 and 5, you need to submit a screenshot of your profile which shows the badges for these modules and your full name on Canvas. 

**Optional but highly recommended**: You can connect your account with your ORCID account to display your certificate on your ORCID account. By doing this, you will also have the chance to receive a paper certificate for this course from NASA together with some stickers. Make sure to share your ORCID ID when submitting your assignment on Canvas.
