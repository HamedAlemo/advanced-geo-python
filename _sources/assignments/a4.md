<!-- # Assignment 4

The goal of this assignment is to work with vector data and implement a scalable vector data anlysis. 

You should submit this assignment to your existing `geog313-assignments` GitHub repository under a new directory named `assignment-4`. Your notebooks should be able to run on Microsoft Planetary Computer (PC) Hub. In the instructions for your code, provide guidance on how users should use your notebook within this hub. You can implement all sections of this assignment in one Notebook. 


*Note*: As you know, the Python environment within the PC Hub can change, so you need to note the version of all packages you are using in your notebook in the documentation so anyone can reproduce your results.

## Download Building Footprint Data

For this assignment you will be working with the [Google-Microsoft Open Buildings Dataset - Combined by VIDA](https://beta.source.coop/repositories/vida/google-microsoft-open-buildings/description/) which is available on Source Cooperative. Check out the [READ ME](https://beta.source.coop/repositories/vida/google-microsoft-open-buildings/description/) of the dataset to understand the datasets and familiarize yourself with its metadata. 

- Write a Python function that receives the ISO code for a country and downloads the corresponding `geoparquet` file or files for that country (Note: you only need to download the data stored under `by_country/`).

- Use this function to download the data for The Philippines.
