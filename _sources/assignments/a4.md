# Assignment 4 

**Due: Wednesday Oct 8th at 11:59 pm ET**

## Goal
Practice the fundamentals of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) and reprojection using Python. And package your work in a Docker container for reproducibility.

---

## Instructions
You should submit this assignment to your existing `geog213-assignments` or `geog313-assignments` GitHub repository under a new directory named `assignment-4/`.
Include:
- An executed Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) with all steps and outputs.
- A `Dockerfile` that builds a reproducible environment.
- A `README.md` with instructions to reproduce the results of your work.
- The provided CSV file in your `assignment-4/` folder.
---

## Dataset
Use the CSV file containing latitudes and longitudes of 10 German cities located [here](german_cities.csv). Save as `german_cities.csv` in your `assignment-4/data/` directory:

## Tasks

### 1) Environment Setup w Docker (15 pts)
Create a `Dockerfile` in `assignment-4/` that:
- Uses a lightweight base image (e.g., `continuumio/miniconda3`).
- Installs the correct version of the following packages in a new environment:
  - `pandas`
  - `pyproj`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `jupyterlab`
- Sets the working directory to `/home/assignment`.
- Configures the container to start JupyterLab on `docker run`.

Make a new commit, and push this part of the assignment to your GitHub repository. 

---

### 2) Load and Inspect (10 pts)
- Load `german_cities.csv` into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Print the first few rows and confirm the CRS is WGS84 (EPSG:4326).
- Briefly explain what EPSG:4326 means (coordinate system, units). Include this in your notebook. 

---

### 3) Transform Coordinates (25 pts)
- Use PyProj to create two CRS objects:
  - WGS84: `EPSG:4326`
  - UTM Zone 32N: `EPSG:32632`
- Transform all city coordinates from WGS84 to UTM Zone 32N.
- Add two new columns to your DataFrame and record the reprojected coordinates: `x_utm` and `y_utm` (in meters).
- Print the updated DataFrame.
- Save the updated DataFrame (with UTM columns) as `results/german_cities_utm.csv`.

---

### 3) Compute Distances (20 pts)
- Select Berlin and Munich.
- Compute the distance between them:
  - In *degrees*.
  - In *meters*.
- Explain why the degree-based distance is misleading.

---

### 4) Compute Bounding Box Area (20 pts)
- Compute and print coordinates of the bounding box containing all 10 cities in:
  - WGS84 (degrees), and 
  - UTM (meters)
- Calculate the *area* of the UTM bounding box in square kilometers.
- Explain why area calculation in degrees is not meaningful. Include this in your notebook. 

---

### 5) Visualization (10 pts)
- Create two simple scatter plots next to each other:
  - The first one with original coordinates (lat vs lon).
  - The second one with projected coordinates (x_utm vs y_utm).
- Add titles and axis labels to show the difference in scale and units.

---

## Deliverables
Your `assignment-4/` directory should include at least the following files:
- `data/german_cities.csv` (provided above)
- `Dockerfile`
- `notebooks/crs_reprojection.ipynb` (executed)
- `results/german_cities_utm.csv`
- `README.md`
