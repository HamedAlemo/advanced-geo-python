# Assignment 6

**Due: Monday Nov 4th at 11:59 pm ET**

In this assignment, you will use Dask, and stackstac to retrieve time series of NDWI values from Sentinel-2 imagery. 

You should submit this assignment to your existing `geog213-assignments` GitHub repository under a new directory named `assignment-6`. 

Create a Dockerfile with all required packages to complete the task, and following best practices covered in the class. Include a `README` in your `assignment-6` directory with all the steps a user needs to follow to reproduce your results. 

You should write a Python function (let's call it `main`) that receives the following inputs: 
1. A bbox in the form of a tuple
1. A start date for searching scenes from a STAC API
1. An end date for searching scenes from a STAC API

and plots the mean NDWI values vs time for all Sentinel-2 scenes returned from the search. 

You should break your pipeline to multiple functions inside the `main` function as following:
1. A function to search and retrieve items from a STAC API. This function should return the collection of items from the search. 
2. A function that receives the following as input
  - a STAC item collection
  - list of assets requested by the user 
  - bbox for clipping the scenes

  and returns a xarray object using stackstac with the requested assets stacked and clipped to the bbox.

 > **Note** You can use the argument `assets` in `stackstac.stack` to only stack specific assets from the item collection (check documentation [here](https://stackstac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/main/stackstac.stack.html#stackstac.stack.params.assets)). This is a good practice to reduce the size of your dask array. 

3. A function that receives an xarray object with bands needed for NDWI included, and returns the mean NDWI for each scene. 
4. A function that receives the mean NDWI and time stamps for each scene, and plots NDWI vs time as point plot. 

All of the steps above should be carried out using Dask lazy computation until the plot computation is executed. 


Now that you have prepared your pipline, create a Jupyter Notebook and do the following:
1. Start a local Dask cluster. 
1. Import the `main` function you have developed. 
1. Plot mean NDWI for the following bbox between *Jan 1st, 2017 and Dec 31st, 2023* using `main`:

`bbox = (32.16033157094111, 22.852984440390316, 33.288140399555346, 23.806193394664234)` 



## [Optional] Filter NDWI Time Series (Extra 3 points)

We know that some pixels from our previous NDWI calculation will be cloudy, and have an incorrect NDWI value. To improve your NDWI plot, create a new function that masks cloudy pixels using the Scene Classification Layer (SCL) band from Sentinel-2. (checkout Table 6 [here](https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/s2-processing#S2-Processing-Scene-Classification) to learn about different values in the SCL layer. You need to exclude any pixel that has a SCL value of 3, 8, 9 or 10)
