    "For each of the steps you identified in your pseudocode, you need to flesh out how you can accomplish each task. \n",

    "Before you design your workflow in more detail, there are many things to keep in mind regarding how you will use and name files, how you will modularize code to reduce repetitive code, etc. \n",

    "\n",
    "Typically you do not want to modify the raw data, so that you can always reproduce your output from the same inputs. In some cases, this is less important, e.g., when you are not tasked with curating the raw data. For example you *could*  re-download any landsat data. \n",

    "In other cases, this is extremely important - you wouldn’t want to recollect a summers worth of field collected data because you accidentally modified the original spreadsheet. \n",

    "A good rule of thumb is to create an “outputs” directory where you store outputs. An outputs directory is helpful because:\n",
    "1. You can always delete and recreate the outputs without worrying about deleting your original data.\n",
    "2. An outputs directory is expressive and reminds anyone looking at your project (including you in the future - i.e. your future self!) where the output products are - they don’t have to dig for the data. \n"
